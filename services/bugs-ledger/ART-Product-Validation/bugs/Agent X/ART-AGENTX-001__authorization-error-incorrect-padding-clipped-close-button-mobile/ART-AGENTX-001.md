## 1. Problem
In Agent X, the authorization error banner displayed on the mobile Select Workspace screen suffers from layout containment and padding defects. The alert container has insufficient right-side padding, causing the dismissible error badge to be visually clipped along the right border and rendering the close ('x') icon partially obscured and difficult to interact with on mobile interfaces.

## 2. Observed Behavior
- On the Agent X mobile Select Workspace screen, an authorization failure renders the alert banner: `Authorization failed: Invalid expiry`.
- The alert banner exhibits insufficient padding and margins along the right boundary.
- The right-side rounded corner of the alert container is visually truncated / clipped.
- The circular close button containing the white `x` glyph is clipped against the right perimeter of the banner and partially obscured.
- The alert content and dismiss button do not appear properly balanced within the alert box.

## 3. Reproduction
1. Open the Agent X mobile application or web client on a mobile device or responsive viewport.
2. Navigate to the Select Workspace screen.
3. Trigger an authorization error (e.g. attempt authentication with an expired session or invalid token yielding `Authorization failed: Invalid expiry`).
4. Observe the rendered error alert banner container and dismiss button.

## 4. Expected Behavior
The error alert container should maintain consistent internal padding and margins on all sides across mobile viewports. The complete alert container, including its rounded corners, should remain visible within the screen, and the close (`x`) button should be fully visible, properly aligned, and easily tappable.

## 5. Business Impact
Degrades user experience and visual polish on mobile devices. A clipped dismiss action hinders mobile users from easily closing the error banner, making the interface appear broken and reducing user confidence during workspace selection and onboarding.

## 6. User Experience
Users encountering an authorization error on mobile see an unbalanced, trimmed alert box where the close button is partially cut off at the right edge, making it difficult to dismiss the error message cleanly.

## 7. Investigation Guidance
Inspect the styling and layout definitions for the authorization error alert container in the Agent X Select Workspace view. Check the CSS/layout rules governing container padding, margins, overflow properties, flex/grid alignment, and responsive constraints on mobile viewports. Compare the right-side padding with the left-side padding and verify that the close button container has adequate right margin/padding without overflowing or being clipped by parent overflow boundaries.

## 8. Fix Requirement
The alert component on mobile viewports must enforce uniform padding, ensure child elements (including the close button) remain within the visible container bounds without clipping, and preserve accessibility and tap target dimensions.

## 9. Recommended Solution
Adjust the container's responsive stylesheet to ensure proper horizontal padding (e.g. symmetric padding on left and right) and ensure `box-sizing: border-box` or appropriate flexbox spacing (`justify-content: space-between`, `align-items: center`) is applied. Ensure parent containers on mobile do not impose clipping (`overflow: hidden`) that cuts off the alert border radius.

## 10. Minimum Working Fix
Apply proper right padding or margin to the error alert container and ensure the close button container is spaced safely away from the right edge so that the button and rounded border remain intact and unclipped.

## 11. Acceptance Criteria
- The error alert banner displays with consistent horizontal and vertical padding on mobile screens.
- The right-side boundary and rounded corners of the alert container are fully visible and unclipped.
- The close (`x`) button is completely visible and positioned with adequate clearance from the container border.
- The close button remains easily tappable with an adequate touch target.
- The alert message text remains clearly readable and balanced.
