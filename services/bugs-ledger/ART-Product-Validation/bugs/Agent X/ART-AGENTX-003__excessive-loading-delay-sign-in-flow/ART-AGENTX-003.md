## 1. Problem

In Agent X, there is a significant loading delay and unstable transition sequence when moving from the Agent X landing screen into the sign-in flow. After the user taps "Sign in with ART", the application displays a full-screen loading spinner for several seconds before the sign-in screen becomes available. Additionally, the transition is unstable, cycling through loading spinner, splash screen, and sign-in states rather than providing a fast, seamless transition.

## 2. Observed Behavior

- The Agent X landing screen is initially displayed with the "Sign in with ART" button.
- After tapping "Sign in with ART", a full-screen loading spinner appears.
- The loading spinner remains visible and active for multiple seconds.
- In recording evidence, the sign-in interface is first reached approximately 8 seconds after initiation.
- The interface subsequently exhibits secondary loading and splash states before returning to the sign-in screen.
- The user is subjected to multiple visual transitions and extended loading delays before the authentication screen is stably usable.

## 3. Reproduction

1. Open the Agent X mobile application or web client to the initial landing screen.
2. Tap "Sign in with ART" to initiate authentication navigation.
3. Observe the full-screen loading spinner duration and subsequent screen transitions before reaching a stable sign-in interface.

## 4. Expected Behavior

After the user selects "Sign in with ART", Agent X should transition promptly to the sign-in screen without excessive loading delay. The navigation should be smooth and stable, avoiding prolonged spinner screens and unnecessary repeated transitions between landing, splash, and sign-in states.

## 5. Business Impact

The excessive delay makes Agent X feel slow, unresponsive, and unreliable during the critical first user interaction. It increases friction for user onboarding and authentication, creating uncertainty as to whether the sign-in action succeeded or stalled.

## 6. User Experience

The user experiences a prolonged loading spinner followed by multiple flickering transitions (splash screen and loading states) before reaching a usable sign-in form, degrading perceived application performance and stability.

## 7. Investigation Guidance

Inspect the Agent X startup and authentication navigation router triggered by "Sign in with ART". Trace the transition sequence from the landing view through the loading controller to the sign-in component. Determine what asynchronous operations, network requests, or redundant lifecycle re-initializations keep the loading state active for several seconds. Investigate why secondary splash/loading screens are re-triggered after the sign-in screen initially mounts.

## 8. Fix Requirement

The Agent X sign-in navigation flow must transition predictably and promptly from the landing screen to the sign-in interface, eliminating unnecessary prolonged loading states and preventing repeated splash or reloading transitions while preserving existing authentication functionality.

## 9. Recommended Solution

Streamline the authentication routing logic triggered by "Sign in with ART". Preload or defer non-blocking initialization tasks, avoid unneeded route redirects or duplicate mount cycles, and ensure the sign-in view renders immediately while background tasks complete asynchronously.

## 10. Minimum Working Fix

Reduce or remove blocking wait conditions in the sign-in transition handler so the sign-in screen renders promptly without multi-second delays or redundant secondary splash screen triggers.

## 11. Acceptance Criteria

- Selecting "Sign in with ART" transitions directly to the sign-in screen within an acceptable loading time.
- The sign-in flow does not remain stuck on a full-screen loading spinner for an extended duration.
- The transition does not cycle through repeated splash or loading screens before stabilizing.
- The sign-in interface (Email, Password, Login button) becomes promptly interactive and usable.
- Existing authentication and sign-in functionality continue to work correctly after the fix.

## 18. Discussion

Supplied recording stills demonstrate an initial landing state, followed by an extended dark loading spinner lasting several seconds, leading into the sign-in form, and then intermittently re-triggering a geometric splash/loading state. The primary defect is the multi-second delay and unstable transition sequence during sign-in initialization.
